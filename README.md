## Installation and Deployment

### Deploy based on docker service

I highly recommend you to deploy based on docker because it is easy to configure.

1. if you havn't install docker, please follow these instructions.

- [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)

2. check if your docker is ready.

```bash
docker version
```

3. pull the [Kyouka bot image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shuyangzhang/kyouka) and [khl-voice image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shuyangzhang/khl-voice).
> Kyouka bot image provides multi-architecture support for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.  
> khl-voice image only support for `linux/amd64` arch.  

> If you are using `Windows/x86_64`, `macos/amd64`, `macos/arm64`, don't worry about that, you can also run images targeted for a different architecture on Docker Desktop.
```bash
docker pull shuyangzhang/kyouka
docker pull shuyangzhang/khl-voice
```

4. copy the `.env.template` file from this repository or clone this repository, then rename it to `.env`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuyangzhang/Kyouka.git
cd Kyouka
mv .env.template .env
```

5. configure the `.env` file.
> WARN: Do not insert any useless characters (including spaces, comments) at the end of the lines of configuration items, otherwise it will cause json parsing failure.
```bash
# your bot token
TOKEN=1/MECxOTk=/zCX2VjWr6p+AmD84jL9asQ==

# default voice channel
CHANNEL=2559449076697969

# the name of khl-voice sdk container, it should be different with your manager(bot) container name
CONTAINER_NAME=kyouka-runner

# the admin user id list
ADMIN_USERS=["693543263"]

# the file_logger switch
FILE_LOGGER=false
```

6. create container for Kyouka bot.
```bash
docker run --name kyouka-manager --env-file .env -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --restart always -d shuyangzhang/kyouka
```

7. now the bot in running, send a `/ping` command in your channel, if Kyouka reply you, that means your deployment is completed, enjoy!
> WARN: make sure that you have granted your bot read & send permissions.

### Deploy based on source code

> if you are using `Win10`/`Win11`, I highly recommend you to run these scripts in WSL2.

> [How to Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

1. same to step 1 of `deploy based on docker service`, install docker and check if it is ready. 
```bash
docker version
```
> make sure that you can run `docker` command without `sudo`. seeing [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)

2. pull the [khl-voice image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shuyangzhang/khl-voice)

```bash
docker pull shuyangzhang/khl-voice
```

3. make sure you have installed `Python`, and its version >= 3.9

> [Download Python for your os](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```

4. clone this repository, then rename `.env.template` file to `.env`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuyangzhang/Kyouka.git
cd Kyouka
mv .env.template .env
```

5. configure the `.env` file.
> WARN: Do not insert any useless characters (including spaces, comments) at the end of the lines of configuration items, otherwise it will cause json parsing failure.
